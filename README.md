# UnderdogStories
Drawing on positive media psychology, this study proposed hypotheses about the relationships among exposure to underdog success stories, cognitive and emotional responses (joy, admiration, unexpectedness, enlightenment, and being moved), liking expressions and sharing intentions on social media. In an online experiment, 320 participants were randomly assigned to watch one of 20 videos featuring either underdog success stories or non-underdog success stories. Results of structural equation modeling showed that participants experienced greater joy, admiration, unexpectedness, and enlightenment when they watched underdog stories than non-underdog stories, and those responses except unexpectedness increased liking expressions and sharing intentions through being moved. The results emphasize the importance of emotionally moving narratives, such as underdog success stories, in driving social media engagement.
